// ==================== MODAL FUNCTIONS ====================
// 
// HOW TO USE:
// 1. Products automatically open modal when clicked
// 2. To add multiple images to a product, add an "images" array:
//    images: [
//      "../assets/images/products/motion/image1.png",
//      "../assets/images/products/motion/image2.png",
//      "../assets/images/products/motion/image3.png"
//    ]
// 3. To add a custom description, add a "description" field
// 4. To set a contact email, add a "contactEmail" field
// 5. If fields are missing, default values will be used automatically

// Open modal with product data
function openModal(product) {
  // Create modal if it doesn't exist
